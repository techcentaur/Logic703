	- 4. Normalisation in Natural deduction proofs
	- 5. Terms, substitution, unification, resolution


### What did the assignment's demo went?

	- 0. I did a coding mistake in nnf where I put Iff(a, b) as And(Impl(a, b), Impl(a, b)) when it is obviously And(Impl(a, b), Impl(b, a)). Rest worked correctly, and so does the examples.
	- 1. Everything correct, with examples.
	- 2. Everything correct, with examples.
